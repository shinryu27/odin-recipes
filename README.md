# odin-recipes
In this lesson I learn the basic of setting up a website using github.
The workflow include creating the repository, use HTML to make the website, and use git to push the changes to github.
In this project I use several HTML basics such as referene links and adding images.
The website display 3 recipes that are listed ou using unordered list and by clicking on one of the recipe will lead us to different website page that explain on how to make the dish.
